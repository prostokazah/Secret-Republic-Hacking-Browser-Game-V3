# Read about the journey

[Read article on Medium](https://medium.com/@adrian.n/secret-republic-open-sourced-hacker-simulation-futuristic-rpg-browser-based-game-php-843d393cb9d7)

# Overview

Audio trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6thfiGb-b7c

A lot of work has gone into this but it (and more in its previous version) is not a documented (as of yet) project.

It's been through years of development with this being its 3rd full do-over.

However, the project on stand-by so I've decided to make the source available of nothing else

# Main Features

1. Audio AI (woman, same as trailer) voice speaks when interacting with the game

2. Futuristic bootstrap based UI, mostly mobile ready

3. UNIX like terminal/command line based missions

4. In-game Mission designer with BBCode like syntax features (see attached Guides and screens)

5. Community features: forums, organizations (guilds), organization forums, blogs, friends, messaging system, automatic mission based tournamens (hackdown), organization specific mission, the grid

6. The grid: every players gets a node to start with and can initialize or conquer other nodes from other players. The world is split in multiple zones, which are split into clusters with a final node granularity. Damage and spy attacks can be triggered between nodes. There's an attempt at a simulator for attacks

7. Abilities & skills which semi-influence command execution time in missions

8. Servers with upgradable hardware (motherboard, ram, hdd, power source, software)

9. Tutorial system

10. Rewards system

# SecretAlpha V4 

V4 is newer, more responsive made with mobile-first in mind, but way less featured.

# Simple Setup

You need a webserver (e.g. MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP) able to run PHP (tested with 7.3) and an MySQL database (LAMP stack).

1. Install `composer` (the PHP dependency management system - `brew install composer` for MacOS) and run `composer install`

2. You will need to create an empty Database in MySQL - it's name is not relevant but you will need it in the next step. For MAMP, you would go to `http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin5`

3. Visit `http://localhost/public_html/setup` - this may be different if you are using another port or directory structure, e.g. `http://localhost:8888/sr/public_html/setup` and follow the setup process

# Cron jobs

Set these up to run periodically as the parameters suggest. The resources one should run maybe every minute

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/attacks/true

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/hourly/true

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/daily/true

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/hackdown/true

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ/rankings/true

localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/attacks/true

e.g.

*/2 * * * * wget -O - http://localhost/cron/key1/MDMwN2Q3OGRiYmM4Y2RkOWZjNTBmMzA4MzViZDZiNjQ=/attacks/true >/dev/null 2>&1
